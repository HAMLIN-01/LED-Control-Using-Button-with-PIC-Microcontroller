# LED-Control-Using-Button-with-PIC-Microcontroller
This project demonstrates how to turn an LED on and off using a push button with a PIC microcontroller. The code is written in Embedded C using MPLAB IDE, and the simulation is done in Proteus. It helps in understanding button interfacing and basic GPIO control in PIC microcontrollers.

# LED-Control-Using-Button-with-PIC-Microcontroller
This project demonstrates how to turn an LED on and off using a push button with a PIC microcontroller. The code is written in Embedded C using MPLAB IDE, and the simulation is done in Proteus. It helps in understanding button interfacing and basic GPIO control in PIC microcontrollers.
# Features
Toggles LED state on button press.
Implements debouncing for stable button operation.
Simple and efficient GPIO handling.
# Tools Used
Microcontroller: PIC, 
Programming Language: Embedded C,
IDE: MPLAB IDE,
Simulation Software: Proteus
# How It Works
The button is connected to a digital input pin of the PIC microcontroller.
The LED is connected to a digital output pin.
When the button is pressed, the microcontroller toggles the LED state (ON/OFF).
